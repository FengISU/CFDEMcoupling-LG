This is a modified version of CFDEM.

Author: Linhan Ge, School of Engineering, the University of Newcastle.

# Typical features:

## CFD-DEM solver with diffiustion averaging method developed by Rui Sun
Grid cells that smaller than particles can be used to resolve the fluid flow.
Examples include are liquid-solid fluidization.

## VOF-DEM solver with diffiustion averaging method developed by Rui Sun
A gas-liquid-solid three phase flow solver is capable of resolving gas-liquid interface using extremely fine meshes whilst ensuring particle dynamics can be resolved physically.

# Installation procedures:

* Install CFDEM as described at https://www.cfdem.com/media/CFDEM/docu/CFDEMcoupling_Manual.html.

* Using the CFDEM repository here to include the three solvers, cfdemSolverDiffusio (CFD-DEM), cfdemSolverVoF (VOF-DEM) and cfdemSolverVoFCyclic (VOF-DEM compatible with periodic domain).
